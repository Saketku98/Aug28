library --> A library is collection of class definitions. The classes and methods are define in it and with the help of function and method we create. 


Q2. What all information is stored in package.json and how is it different from package-lock.json?
Ans-> Package.json contains information about the project that we are working on and it also contains dependencies on package that we had installed. If we import a package then it is possible that it is using other package then they will also import.
      It is different from package-lock.json because package-lock.json is created by the node package manager automatically we just use it. and we never touch this file.
